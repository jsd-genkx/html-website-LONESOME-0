    <h1>This is me 34_Thanasin(Com)</h1>
    <h2>Why am I here?</h2>
    <p>I want to become a JAVA backend developer.</p>

    <h2>What excites me most about this program?</h2>
    <p>Learning how to code is the most exciting to me.
    </p>

    <h2>What makes me the most nervous about this program?</h2>
    <p>I would say that making new friends makes me the most nervous because getting to know someone is quite hard for
        me. I tend to be shy and don’t talk much to strangers. However, after spending time in this bootcamp, I’ve
        realized that making friends isn’t as difficult as I thought. Now, I’m really happy to be part of this camp
        because I’ve met great people and am in such a positive environment.</p>
