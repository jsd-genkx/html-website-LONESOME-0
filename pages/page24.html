            <h3>Why am i here?</h3>
            <p>"I'm interested in Full-stack development because it feels new and challenging for me in Thailand, as many people are interested in this position."</p>

            <h3>What excites me most about this program?</h3>
            <p>"I think CSS and JavaScript are really exciting for me because I do not have much knowledge about them. It's quite challenging."</p>

            <h3>What makes me the most nervous about this program?</h3>
            <p>"It might be because I’ve never studied anything related to tech, so I don’t have much knowledge in this field. When I came across the Generation Thailand program, I started from zero, and this program has helped me gain more knowledge and skills."</p>
        </div>

        <div id="w4">
            <h3>What else should people know about me?</h3>
            <p>I would like others to know that I am ready to learn new things and face challenges. I am determined to develop my skills in technology, and even though I started from zero, I am committed and working hard to grow in this field. Additionally, I am interested in both front-end (CSS, JavaScript) and back-end (Full-stack development), which are highly sought-after skills in the job market.</p>
